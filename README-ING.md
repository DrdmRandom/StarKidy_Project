**Starkidy_Project**
Description
Starkidy_Project is a Learning Management System (LMS) specifically designed for Starkidy Pre-school in Semarang. This project was developed as part of an effort to provide effective and interactive educational solutions for young children. As a Telkom University student in the senior semester, I developed this system to help overcome educational challenges in the early stages of learning.

Feature:
Starkidy_Project adalah Sistem Manajemen Pembelajaran (LMS) yang dirancang khusus untuk Sekolah Pra-sekolah Starkidy di Semarang. Proyek ini dikembangkan sebagai bagian dari usaha untuk menyediakan solusi pendidikan yang efektif dan interaktif bagi anak-anak usia dini. Sebagai mahasiswa Telkom University di semester tua, saya mengembangkan sistem ini untuk membantu mengatasi tantangan pendidikan pada tahap awal pembelajaran.

- Absence System: absences for students and teachers can be done via this LMS system, intended to make it easier to take absences and track absences.
- Report Book System: The diary will turn digital to make the teacher's work flow easier and more efficient
- Announcement System: Schools can make announcements more efficiently and ensure they reach the students' parents
- In App Message: communicating between parents and teachers is easier and safer.
- payment system: parents can now pay school bills easily.
- Leason Plane: teachers can now create milestone targets for children easily and will be supported by the LMS system to view and assess.
